- The task of the game is to select active selectors in the HTML Viewer. Selectors are presented in the form of animals, active animals are animated.
- When you hover over an animal or selector in the HTML Viewer, the animal and the corresponding selector will be highlighted, and a hint will appear next to the animal indicating the appropriate selector.
- The selector must be written to a line in the "CSS Editor" field, after which the user must press the Enter button (or the Enter key on the keyboard).
- If the answer turns out to be correct, you will go to the next level. In case of passing all levels, a congratulatory window will appear.
- If the answer turns out to be incorrect, the animation of the code block twitching will work.
- If you do not know the correct answer, you can use the hint by clicking on the Help button in the "CSS Editor", in this case the icon in the row of the completed level will turn red.
